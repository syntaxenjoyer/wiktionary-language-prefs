# wiktionary-language-prefs

A simple userscript that allows you to change the order that languages appear on Wiktionary. Populate the langPrefs array with the languages that you would like moved to the top in the order that you would like them, e.g. langPrefs = ['English', 'Spanish', 'French', 'Arabic'] etc.

The script will work in any language that there is a Wiktionary for. However, the preferences must be set in the language you wish to use the script on. For example, if you want to reorder both the Spanish and English Wiktionaries, the preferences array might be: langPrefs = ['English', 'Spanish', 'French', 'Arabic', 'Inglés', 'Español', 'Francés', 'Árabe'] etc.

This script can also be installed from Greasy Fork here: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/466882-wiktionary-language-prefs
